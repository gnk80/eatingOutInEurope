#### About it
This Jupyter notebook is the one I've published on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gnk980/eating-out-in-europe/notebook) starting from the data available on [this datasource](https://www.kaggle.com/damienbeneschi/krakow-ta-restaurans-data-raw)
It was fun to experiment some charts and a little Sentiment Analysis to see how TripAdvisor's users decided to share about their personal experiences
